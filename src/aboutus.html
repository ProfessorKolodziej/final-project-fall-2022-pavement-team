    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <h2>We are inspired by the energy of the city—how the pavement connects us and how it belongs to everyone. The city streets get us to where we want to go, and ultimately, can bring us together. Pavement Coffeehouse was born in 2009 with the goal of creating a unique, personal, and inspired coffee scene in Boston. We wanted a space that was eclectic yet approachable, highlighting the coffees that we were most excited about, each served with intention. With that in mind, we showcased our craft coffee by building a gathering place for Boston’s many vibrant neighborhoods and subcultures—a coffeehouse where everyone feels that they belong.</h2>
